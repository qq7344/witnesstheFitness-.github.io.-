It is our goal that by making the initial connection between new people as simple as possible, more of our target audience will work collaboratively in the gym. Also, by gamifying the gym experience and adding a competitive element, we are certain people will in-turn be more social and outgoing in the gym.</p>

								<h2 class="section-title mt-0">The inspiration</h2>
								<p class="section-paragraph">We found out there is lack of commucation in the gym so we designed this idea to help promote social interaction in a casual gym environment. Specifically, our product is designed to help young adults who go to the gym on a semi-regular basis meet new people to train with. This idea was inspired by our initial research, which identified that both new and experienced gym-goers want to meet new people at the gym but often lack the confidence to do so. As a result, weâ€™ve listened to our audience, and incorporated a range of social and mobile technologies to help combat this issue.</p>
